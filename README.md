# Weather-App
A weather app built with React and Bootstrap using the openweathermap api.
This application is still in production.
To search for weather of a location, just type in any location around the world and hit the search button.

Current Bugs:
- Forecast not passing to the sidebar component and refreshing without page reload.
- Geolocation api call dependent on browser.

Functionality to be added:
- Save user's previous searches.
- Button to generate weather of a random location.

If attempting to load the application locally

1. npm install
  This will install all the dependencies required for the application.
  
2. npm start
  This is to run the application, which will open in localhost/3000
